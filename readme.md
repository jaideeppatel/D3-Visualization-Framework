Many web libraries are used to make this project function:

* [AngularJS]
* [Twitter Bootstrap]

### Installation

First, check out this project. Duh.

You need npm, grunt, and git installed globally:
* Git can be installed from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
* NPM can be installed from: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

Grunt
```sh
> npm install grunt
```

After grunt, npm, and git have been installed and added to your system's path:

* Open a command prompt/terminal 
* Navigate to the project directory (which include Gruntfile.js)
* in your prompt, enter:
```sh
> grunt sometask --arg1=Opt1
```
* Grunt will notify you of any missing dpendencies or errors parsing the scripts. 

The following code is used to access a simple UI for running pre-bundled grunt tasks. Enter this in your prompt, and follow the instructions given.
```sh
> grunt prompt
```

To update the Grunt package.json file, run the following command:
```sh
npm update --save
```
